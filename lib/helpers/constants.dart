    'With over 12 years of web development experience, I am a highly skilled, versatile, and self-taught '
    'programmer who can build integrations between apps and systems using serverless technologies. '
    'I have gained the programming skills to the highest possible level, enhanced by constant research '
    'and professional development. My education in web development has been 100% commercially focused, '
    'rather than wasteful theory.';

    'The internet is everywhere. Having a mobile device is the norm and the days for targeting '

const jobLH =
    'I built integrations between apps/systems and contributed to the open source Frigg framework '
    '(https://github.com/friggframework). Which lets you integrate your or 3rd party apps with easy '
    'using serverless technologies on AWS or GCP. My role as a developer was to build API modules and '
    'also improvements to the framework\'s core. I was part of a great team in charge on delivering '
    'solutions to respectable clients like Canva, Freshbooks and many others.';

const jobPJ =
    'I developed a Campaign Management System from zero for Pay Justice. It made a huge impact to a point '
    'that it is now an integral part of their business model and their clients. One of its strengths is that '
    'it is not a monolithic backend server running everything but a group of microservices cooperating with '
    'each other. One of them was in charge of automating tasks, scheduling or sending an email immediately '
    '(or text message) based on any change made to any of their records is a piece of cake (Remember Zapier? '
    'This darling can do some of that too). What I’m really proud of this solution is that it was designed to '
    'grow and achieve unexpected goals. This project is an ongoing effort and I’ve worked on it for 5 years.';

const jobFXO =
    'I started working for Flow XO as a services integration developer. The core of the platform was almost '
    'complete when I landed there but it couldn’t do much without integrating with 3rd party services out there. '
    'My main job was to develop as many integrations as I could. Some popular integrations I did were with '
    'Google Gmail, Docs and other of their products, also with Todoist, Harvest and many others. My managers were '
    'so happy with my work that they moved me in as a core developer. Around this time, I was part of the team in '
    'charge of transforming Flow XO from automation platform to a bot platform. I’m proud to say that the goal '
    'was accomplished satisfactorily. I worked on this project for 18 months.';
